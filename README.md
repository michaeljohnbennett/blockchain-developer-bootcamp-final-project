# Idea 1: NFT Battle Cards
A game where you collect NFTs with specific attributes and then play them against other People.

The main part of the process is the random generation of NFT's based on some statistics and attributes. Your cards are joined together to make a deck or a warrior/player so you can play the game against others or NPE's who are graded against you.

You can also use the NFT's in yield farming contracts to increase your yield depending on their rarity. If you generate a card that has a specificily high rarity, a portion of the yield bonus is given to some charity or other grouping the NFT is associated with. This could be used to make an autonomous pool of prizes for people to win when they have a dungeon battle or you perhaps organise a tournament.

Overall the battle process would be done via stats and random numbers picking along the probability distribution of the two stats. PVE's would be generated with some balancing logic to make them more or less close to the player so there is some chance to win but its not certain.

We record the outputs of the battle to the output event and then it gets played onto the screen so the player can see the battle outputs and know if he has won or lost. 

# Idea 2: Generative Art & Steganography

A system where you can generate a NFT and add in some secret data to the image (wether that be encoded into the image as text/base64 or encrypted) and is then minted. You can give the card to someone else and they can have the ability to read it somehow or use it eventually somewhere else.

It's a novel use of cryptography, steganography and NFTs to allow people to customise their NFT or use it as message to someone.

Perhaps it is inside the generative art image itself or in the NFT payload. 

# Idea 3: Unsure at this time

I had done previous work in trading and token distribution work but I'd like to do something in the NFT space as I think it's a fun place and there is a huge place for gaming to happen. Perhaps looking at using sidechains or interesting ways to make the games faster, cheaper or easier to deploy/make.
